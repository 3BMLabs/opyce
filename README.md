# opyce
integrates python into any office app!

# vision

python should be available in office, in its fullest form:
- open a python window with the click of a button
- to accelerate this software, code will be written into C++.
- this library will function like an API between python and office/libreoffice.

## microsoft office
- call VBA functions from python and access VBA fields
- call python functions from VBA and f.e. excel values
## libreoffice

# script marketplace
we'll have a marketplace containing opyce scripts, to get started easily.

# concrete
- when clicking on the python button on office, a new window, containing a python interpreter, will pop up. the files it contains will be in the temp folder.
- when saving the excel document, the python files will be saved inside of the document.
- the window could be a VSCode window. the python interpreter will be downloaded as recommended extension.
