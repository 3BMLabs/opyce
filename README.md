# opyce
integrates python into any office app!

# vision

python should be available in office, in its fullest form:
- open a python window with the click of a button
- to accelerate this software, code will be written into C++.
- this library will function like an API between python and office/libreoffice.

## microsoft office
- call VBA functions from python and access VBA fields
- call python functions from VBA and f.e. excel values
## libreoffice
